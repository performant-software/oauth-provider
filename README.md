# Simple OAuth2 provider

This application uses Ruby on Rails, [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise), and [Doorkeeper](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper) to provide a lightweight service for OAuth clients. It is optimized for free deployment on [Heroku](https://heroku.com) but can be set up in any environment suitable for hosting Rails applications.
